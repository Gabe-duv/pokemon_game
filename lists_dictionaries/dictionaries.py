# I would like you to create a dictionary for Squirtle, Bulbasaur and any other pokemon you like (you can make up the stats) remember, this is only practice so there's no need to make loads.

# Once you have done that I would like you to write a while loop that takes input from the user and prints out the desired stats for the pokemon.
